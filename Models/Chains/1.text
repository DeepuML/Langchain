One sunny afternoon, Tom the cat was lounging lazily in the living room, dreaming about finally catching Jerry, the clever little mouse who had outsmarted him countless times.

Suddenly, a delicious smell wafted in from the kitchen.

Cheese. Swiss cheese. Loads of it.

Jerry had already caught the scent and tiptoed out of his hole, eyes wide with excitement. A whole platter of cheese was left unattended on the kitchen table.

Jerry zoomed across the floor in a flash, leapt up a broom, bounced off a hanging spoon, and landed perfectly on the table.

Just as he was about to grab a chunk—BAM! Tom sprang out of a cupboard with a chef’s hat and a net.

“Gotcha this time!” he yelled.

But Jerry was too quick. He ducked, flipped, and flung a slice of cheese straight into Tom’s face, blinding him for a second. The chase was on!

Around the table, through the pantry, over the toaster, and under the couch they went. Jerry led Tom into a maze of string traps he had set earlier, causing Tom to get tangled like a puppet on strings.

Thinking he was safe, Jerry turned around and laughed.

BIG mistake.

Tom broke free and launched himself like a rocket, flying through the air. At the last second, Jerry ducked—and Tom flew straight into the fridge, slamming the door shut behind him.

Silence. Then... muffled meows from inside the fridge.

Jerry giggled, grabbed a small piece of cheese, and walked back to his hole, whistling happily.

Moral of the story:
Sometimes brains are better than brawn... especially when cheese is on the line!
