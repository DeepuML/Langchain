      "1. **The \"Googly\":**  The googly, a type of delivery bowled by a right-arm leg-spinner that spins the opposite way to a normal leg break, is a deceptively simple yet incredibly difficult ball to master.  Its invention revolutionized spin bowling and remains a crucial weapon in the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cricket's Global Reach:** While deeply rooted in England, cricket is now a truly global sport.  It's hugely popular in countries like India, Australia, Pakistan, South Africa, the West Indies, and Bangladesh, with passionate fan bases and highly competitive leagues.  This diverse following makes it one of the most widely played sports in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Longest Test Match:** The longest Test match in cricket history lasted a staggering 10 days!  Played between England and South Africa in 1939, it was eventually drawn after numerous interruptions due to bad weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The \"Bodyline\" Controversy:** The 1932-33 Ashes series saw the infamous \"Bodyline\" tactic employed by England against Australia.  This involved deliberately bowling at the batsman's body to intimidate them and limit scoring.  It sparked a major controversy and was widely condemned for its aggressive and dangerous nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Unusual Dismissals:** Cricket has a unique set of dismissal methods.  Beyond the common ways like bowled, caught, and leg before wicket (LBW), there are rare and unusual dismissals like \"hit the ball twice,\" \"handled the ball,\" and \"obstructing the field,\" adding to the game's quirky and unpredictable nature.\n"

      "3. **Black holes evaporate (very slowly):**  Due to a phenomenon called Hawking radiation, black holes slowly lose mass and energy over incredibly long timescales.  The smaller the black hole, the faster it evaporates.  However, for stellar-mass black holes, this evaporation time is far longer than the current age of the universe.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Multiple Unemployment Measures Show Varied Results:**  India's unemployment rate is difficult to pinpoint due to discrepancies between data sources like the PLFS (using a broader definition) and CMIE (offering more frequent, but potentially less rigorous, data).  This reflects the complexities of measuring unemployment in India's diverse economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Underlying Causes are Multifaceted:** High unemployment stems from a combination of factors including a large young population needing jobs (demographic dividend), slow economic growth, skills mismatches, dominance of the informal sector, technological displacement, agricultural stagnation, and inefficient labor markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Severe Social and Economic Consequences:**  High unemployment leads to increased poverty and inequality, social unrest, reduced economic growth, brain drain, and negative impacts on mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Solutions Require a Multi-pronged Approach:**  Addressing the issue requires a comprehensive strategy including investments in skill development, promotion of entrepreneurship, improved infrastructure, labor law reforms, increased agricultural productivity, attracting foreign investment, strengthening social safety nets, and data-driven policymaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sustained Effort and Monitoring are Crucial:**  Solving India's unemployment problem demands a long-term, coordinated effort from government, private sector, and civil society, along with continuous monitoring and evaluation of implemented policies to ensure effectiveness.\n",

      "**Advantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
      "* Works well with more dimensions than samples.\n",
      "* Memory efficient (uses support vectors).\n",
      "* Versatile (different kernel functions).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disadvantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Prone to overfitting with high feature/sample ratio.\n",
      "* Doesn't directly provide probability estimates (expensive calculation needed).  Computationally expensive methods like five-fold cross-validation are required for probability estimates.\n",
      "* Requires consistent data type (dense/sparse) during fitting and prediction. Use `float64` for optimal performance.  Scikit-learn accepts both dense (numpy.ndarray) and sparse (scipy.sparse) sample vectors. For optimal performance, C-ordered numpy.ndarray (dense) or scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (sparse) with dtype=float64 are recommended.\n",

      "2. **Q: What is one advantage of SVMs regarding high-dimensional data?**\n",
